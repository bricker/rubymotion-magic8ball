## Magic 8-Ball

This is the simple Magic 8-Ball iOS application that is built in a 
[RubyMotion introductory video](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion) 
by Mike Clark of [Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/).

This repository is the result of me going through the tutorial and writing the
code along with the video (and improving it of course, otherwise I couldn't call
myself a self-righteous Ruby developer). 

The images and answers file are copied directly from the tutorial's 
[source code repository](https://github.com/pragmaticstudio/studio-bonus-tracks/tree/master/episode-020/Magic8Ball),
but is otherwise hand-made!
